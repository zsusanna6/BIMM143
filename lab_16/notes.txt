> Q. What does the star character accomplish here? Ask Barry, or your class neighbor, if you are not sure!

The star character represents all the files with the extension after the star.
In this case, it represents all the gunzip fasta files. 

> Q. How many sequences are in this mouse.1.protein.faa file? Hint: Try using grep to figure this out…
57119 sequences in mouse.1.protein.faa
31512 sequences in mouse.2.protein.faa
53634 sequences in zebrafish.1.protein.faa


> Q. What happens if you run the above command without the > mm-first.fa part?
It will display the first 2 sequences of mouse protein on the terminal

> Q. What happens if you were to use two ‘>’ symbols (i.e. >> mm-first.fa)?


> Q.How would you determine how many sequences are in the mm-second.fa file?
